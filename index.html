    <h3>Queue algorithm form Data Structure</h3>

    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue">

        In computer science, a priority queue is an abstract data type similar to a regular queue or stack data
        structure in which each element additionally has a "priority" associated with it. In a priority queue, an
        element with high priority is served before an element with low priority. In some implementations, if two
        elements have the same priority, they are served according to the order in which they were enqueued, while in
        other implementations, ordering of elements with the same priority is undefined.

    <pre>
    insert(node) {
        list.append(node)
      }
      </pre>

    <pre>
      pull() {
        highest = list.get_first_element()
        foreach node in list {
           if highest.priority < node.priority {
               highest = node
           }
        }
        list.remove(highest)
        return highest
      }
    </pre>

    <p>In another case, one can keep all the elements in a priority sorted list (O(n) insertion sort time ), whenever
        the highest-priority element is requested, the first one in the list can be returned. ( O(1) pull time )</p>

    <pre>
      insert(node) {
        highest = list.get_first_element()
        foreach (index, element) in list {
          if node.priority < element.priority {
             list.insert_at_index(node,index)
          }
        }
      }
    </pre>

    highest = list.get_at_index(list.length-1)
    list.remove(highest)
