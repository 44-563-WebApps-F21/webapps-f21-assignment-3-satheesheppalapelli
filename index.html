    <h3>Banglore</h3>
    <p>Bangalore is widely regarded as the <b>Silicon Valley of India</b> ("IT capital of India") because of its role as
        the nation's leading information technology (IT) exporter.
        A demographically diverse city, Bangalore is the second fastest-growing major metropolis in India.
        It's also known <b>Garden city of India</b>.

        I like this main because of home to many <b>educational and research institutions</b>.
        Numerous state-owned aerospace and defence organisations are located in the city.
        It was ranked the most <b>liveable Indian city with a population of over a million</b>.
