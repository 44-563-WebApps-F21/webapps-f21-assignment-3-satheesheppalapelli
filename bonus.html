    <h3>The Red Naga</h3>
    <p> Naga, a member of the Homo mermanus species, was born five hundred years ago in Lemuria, a submarine continent
        in the Pacific Ocean. Through some means, Naga became the emperor of Lemuria and a worshipper of serpent god
        Set,
        who considered Naga a valuable servant.
